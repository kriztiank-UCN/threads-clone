1. Set the DATABASE_URL in the .env file to point to your existing database. If your database has no tables yet, read https://pris.ly/d/getting-started
2. Set the provider of the datasource block in schema.prisma to match your database: postgresql, mysql, sqlite, sqlserver, mongodb or cockroachdb.     
3. Run prisma db pull to turn your database schema into a Prisma schema.
4. Run prisma generate to generate the Prisma Client. You can then start querying your database.

The database has two tables the first one is
model Posts: we have an: 
id - which is auto increment
userId - with a uuid 
name 
image 
text 
picture  - the picture is like a long string of characters 
createdAt - which is the date 
likes - which is a one-to-many relationship 

The second one is:
model Likes:
id - which is auto increment
userId - with a uuid 
postId - because like or likes are associated with a certain postId  
createdAt - which is the date 
post - which defines the relationship, postId and id are related, when you
delete the post it also Cascades and deletes all of the likes associated with
that post
